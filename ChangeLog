  classes then the peer.
- Support to parse 802.1AB Organizationally Specific TLVs, Cisco Specific TLVs
  and the LLINK attributes of the DCBX CEE TLVs.
- Support to reconfigure and set the MSAP subtype.
- Additional gcc warnings turned on and miscellaneous fixes.
Changes from 0.9.40 through 0.9.43

Changes from 0.9.39 through 0.9.40
- Add iSCSI TLV support
Changes from 0.9.26 through 0.9.39
- Numerous bug fixes and code cleanup
- Reworked netlink event handling to be more robust and handle dropped nlmsgs.
- DCBx puts netdevice into linkmode until dcbx negotiation complete
Changes from 0.9.21 through 0.9.26
- Fork dcbd into lldpad and make the daemon a generic LLDP agent deamon.
Changes from 0.9.19 through 0.9.21
- Update libconfig to version 1.3.2.  Fix code to match API changes.
- Add dcbd -k -s options in README and manpage.
- Fix dcbd seg fault when dcbd.conf version string is not 1.0.
- Move the dcbd.conf out of the /etc/sysconfig/ directory into /var/lib/dcbd.
Changes from 0.9.15 through 0.9.19
- Send App priority information to driver via netlink (if kernel supports)
- dcbtool returns non-zero status on error
- Allow user priority percentages (uppct) to be changed while using DCBX v2.
- Improved dcbtool parameter parsing to detect invalid arguments.
- Fixed segfault which occurred in some cases of the config file was removed.
- Fixed dcbtool get app oper error.
Changes from 0.9.7 through 0.9.15
- Set FeatureSeqNo to 1 in the case of peer expiration.
- Use the MSG_DONTWAIT flag in the recv socket call to avoid potential of making
  a blocking call - which would hang dcbd.
- Move initialization of control interface before call to init ports to
  avoid use of uninitialized variable.
- Add support of SAN MAC address, get SAN MAC address through driver interface. 
- Add -s, -k command line options.
- Dcbd, dcbtool man pages and README are updated.
- Set the SO_PRIORITY of the LLDP socket to TC_PRIO_CONTROL (7).  This will
  help the driver to know not to priority tag the LLDP packets.
- Add shared memory segment to save some DCBX state information when
  dcbd stops.  Used to restore DCBX state on restart of dcbd.
- Change default dcbx version to 2.
- Only send the version 2 DCBX TLV when in dcbx version 2 mode (instead of
  both version TLVs).
- Fix dcbd init script so that it loads the dcbnl module for kernels which
  have the option of a dcbnl module.
- A dcbtool error message was changed from "Device not found" to 
  "Device not found, link down or DCB not enabled"
- Each DCB feature (PFC, PG, ...) was modified in driver to indicate whether
  or not a hw reset is required when the feature configuration changes.
  If a HW reset will occur, then dcbd will not react to the next link bounce.
- Ensure that HW flow control settings are synced with the DCBX operational
  state.
- Runlevel 4 removed from the dcbd init script.
- Fix error flag for willing==willing case.
- Don't print out error message anymore in remove_adapter for the default
  config object for objects which aren't created for the default config.
- Fixed potential memory leak in rare shutdown scenarios
- Deleted line of unreachable dead code.
- Remove BCN support from dcbd and dcbtool
- Limit values for DcbxSubtype  - Write Operational DcbxSubtype  for query
- For dcbx version 2, rebalance bandwidth % assignements on set of Priority
  Group feature
